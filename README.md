- 👋 Hi, I’m @quizzical-spade
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux cmd line, bash scripting, and learning enough to experience the Year of the Linux Desktop in 2025.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Engineering, broadly
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, unless you have a time turner or the ability to grant more hours in a day!
- 📫 Reach me on Discord @quizzicalspade
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can solve one Rubik's cube, touch-type with two hands, speak three languages and play four instruments. Not at the same time, though.
